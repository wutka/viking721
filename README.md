# Viking 721 Terminal Emulator
This will hopefully eventually be an emulator for a CDC Viking 721
terminal. The Viking terminal had a Z80 processor and could do a
number if interesting things including running CP/M. This emulator
is only concerned with the basic terminal features, specifically for
use with Tom Hunter's Desktop Cyber program.

It is still not complete, the Z80 emulator I was using didn't have
support for interrupts and I'm not sure that works yet, and I haven't
connected up the keyboard or the comm line yet.
