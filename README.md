# Viking 721 Terminal Emulator
This will hopefully eventually be an emulator for a CDC Viking 721
terminal. I was originally trying to get it to run the original ROM
files using a Z80 emulator, but I have scrapped that and am just trying
to implement the features, particularly the control sequences,
documented in the ROM manual. Also, I am still using the original
character set from the terminal.
